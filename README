step 1:
Generate v4 and v6 file lists and download the files.
These are accomplished in the /v4 and /v6 directories.

step 2:
run main.py, which will create three files: 4output, 6ouput and alloutput.
This will take some time. However, if you have run main.py before and the output files exist, the run time will be significantly reduced.

notice:
You don't have to delete the output files before running main.py again. The program will deal with it.
You need to change the hard disk name (hd_name) when running the program in different computers.
